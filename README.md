## Hello!

I'm Andy, a 3rd year PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by [Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/) in the [Crowd Dynamics Lab](https://crowddynamicslab.github.io/). Broadly, I work in algorithmic game theory and mechanism developing models and algorithms for helping people make decisions under complexity and uncertainty. I am particularly interested in models and mechanisms considering attention as a scarce resource.

In my free time I enjoy racquet sports, cooking, and watching movies. You may find some of my work, contact information, and a picture of my face below.

### Work
